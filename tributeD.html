               <h3><b>Early life</b></h3>
              <h5> Drogba is a member of the Bété people[19] He was born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and at the age of five was sent to France by his parents to live with his uncle, Michel Goba, a professional footballer. However, Drogba soon became homesick and returned to Abidjan after three years.[20] His mother nicknamed him "Tito", after president Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, whom she admired greatly.[21] He played football every day in a car park in the city but his return to the Ivory Coast was short lived. Both of his parents lost their jobs and he again returned to live with his uncle.[20] In 1991, his parents also travelled to France; first to Vannes and then, in 1993, setting in Antony in the Paris suburbs, at which point the 15-year-old Drogba returned to live with them and his siblings.[22] It was here that he began playing team football more frequently, joining a local youth side. Drogba then joined the semi-professional club Levallois, gaining a reputation as a prolific scorer in the youth team and impressing the coach with his professional attitude. His performances earned him a place in the senior squad but despite scoring in his debut,
                   the 18-year-old Ivorian failed to make an impression on Jacques Loncar, the first team coach.[23]</p>

                <h3> <b>Club career</b></h3>
                <i>Le Mans</i>
                <h5>When Drogba finished school he moved to the city Le Mans to study accountancy at university and he had to change clubs, becoming an apprentice at Ligue 2 club Le Mans. However, his first two years there were marred by injuries and he was physically struggling to cope with the training and match schedule.[20] Former Le Mans coach Marc Westerloppe later remarked that "it took Didier four years to be capable of training every day and playing every week". Furthermore, Drogba's complicated family life meant that he had never attended a football academy and only began daily football training as a fully grown adult.[24]

                    By age 21, Drogba realised that he had to establish himself as a player soon or else he would have little chance of becoming a professional footballer.[25] He made his first team debut for Le Mans soon thereafter and signed his first professional contract in 1999. The same year, he and his Malian wife Alla had their first child, Isaac. He grew into his new responsibilities, later stating: "Isaac's birth was a turning point in my life, it straightened me out".[20] His first season, in which he scored seven goals in thirty games, boded well for the future, but during the following season he did not live up to expectations. Drogba lost his place to Daniel Cousin due to injury, then upon his return, he failed to score throughout the remainder of the season. 
                    However, he returned to form the following season, scoring five goals in 21 appearances  </h5>

                <h3> <b>Guingamp</b></h3>
                <h5> Halfway through the 2001–02 season Ligue 1 club Guingamp consolidated months of interest with a transfer offer and Drogba left Le Mans for a fee of £80,000.[20] The second half of the 2001–02 season saw Drogba make 11 appearances and score three goals for Guingamp. While his contributions helped the club avoid relegation, the coaching staff remained unconvinced of their new young striker.[27] However, the next season he rewarded his coaches' patience, scoring 17 goals in 34 appearances and helping Guingamp finish seventh, a record league finish.[20] He credited his teammates for his impressive season, highlighting the contributions of winger Florent Malouda, a long time friend of Drogba, as a key factor in his goalscoring prolificity that season.[25] His strong goal scoring record attracted interest from larger clubs and at the end of the season,
                     he moved to Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille for a fee of £3.3 million</h5>

                <h3> <b>Marseille</b></h3>
                <h5>After a switch of coaches, Drogba retained his position in the team, scoring 19 goals and winning the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Player of the Year award. He also scored five goals in that season's UEFA Champions League and six in the UEFA Cup. At the end of the season, he was bought by Chelsea as the club's then record signing for £24 million.[25] His shirt from his only season at Marseille is also framed in the basilica of Marseille,
                     Notre-Dame de la Garde, which he presented to the church before the 2004 UEFA Cup Final</h5>

             <p>
                <h3><b>Chelsea</b></h3>
                <h5> Signing for Chelsea in July 2004 for £24 million,[29] Drogba scored in his third game for the club with a header against Crystal Palace.[30] His season was interrupted when he pulled a stomach muscle against Liverpool which kept him out of action for over two months.[31] Chelsea won the Premier League, only their second English top-flight championship and their first in 50 years,[32] and the League Cup. Later, Drogba scored in extra time in a 3–2 final win against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. Drogba scored a somewhat disappointing 16 goals in a total of 40 games for Chelsea in his first season: ten in the Premier League, five in the Champions League and one in the League Cup final.[33]

                    Drogba started the 2005–06 season by scoring two goals in a Community Shield win over Arsenal. His reputation was marred amidst accusations of cheating during Chelsea's 2–0 win over Manchester City. Replays showed that he had used his hand to control the ball before scoring the second of his two goals.[34] This occurred just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where the goal was disallowed.[35] Chelsea went on to retain the league title with two games to play, becoming only the second club to win back-to-back English titles in the Premier League era.[36] Again Drogba finished with 16 goals for the season, 12 in the Premier League, two in the Community Shield, one in the Champions League and one in the FA Cup </h5>
